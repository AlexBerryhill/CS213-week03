# CS213-week03
1. The second part of the assignment is to apply what you have learned about CSS to a given example. In this case, there is a simple HTML document with four associated style sheets. Through some JavaScript code, the viewer of the page can switch between the style sheets with a click of the button.
2. Work with your group on making the visual presentation of the content of the page change as drastically as possible through the style sheets. This includes the coloring, fonts, as well as the layout of the page itself. Points will be awarded according to how dramatically the presentation of the page changes.
3. Start with week03.html (Links to an external site.). Since your entire group will edit the same document and submit it together, you will need to contact each of them and come up with a collaboration strategy. I suggest you create a post in this discussion board with proposals how this is to be done and with your group's final decision.
4. You can post your solution anywhere you want. You may wish to put it under your  public_html directory on the Linux system. Regardless of your decision, make it clear to the instructor where the final page is located so it can be graded. In other words, put a link in the discussion board to the page by the response due date (see calendar).
